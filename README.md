# JadenSmithBot
A TwitterBot that knows the truth that The Man is keeping from you.

1. Find its wisdom here: https://twitter.com/jadensmith_bot
2. First time user? Check out "MAIN.py" for the most crucial code, 
    and an in-depth explanation of what's going on.
3. Running this file from your computer won't work without a file 
    called "secrets.json", which has some of the important Twitter keys. 
    I didn't put it on GitHub, to protect the security of this app.
    Contact Danny at dsepler@ufl.edu or through Facebook for this file.
4. This app relies on "Tweepy" and "Twython" in order to function correctly.
    To install them, use `pip install tweepy` and `pip install twython` on your command line.
    If you don't have pip on your computer, Google it and download it.
5. Still have questions? Guess that means I didn't do my job right with the
    documentation. Or... got any ideas for where I can take this app next? Reach out 
    to me, and I'll do my best to make this app work for you!
6. This app is hosted on a droplet on DigitalOcean. Want access to that? Reach out to
    me.
    
Hack on.
